            I smelt trouble the moment that broad walked into my office and flirted her false eyelashes at me. She'd lead me to three dead corpses and a stolen flute.
		</div>
		<div>
            Oh, hi guys, I'm living in the 1930's as a private dick, and it's gritty and dirty and greyscale, and you never know if you're gonna wind up in a house with a beautiful dame or a bloated fat man with a cryptic note stuffed in his mouth, and a book of matches that lead you to the seedy diner on 54th and a half street where you can slurp milkshakes through a twirly pink straw and listen to the jukebox shoo-wop shooby-doo-wop, and the bathrooms are clean.
		</div>

		</div>
		<div>
            The diner belonged to an old Italian gentleman by the name of Giuseppe, who had a penchant for rolled-up shirtsleeves and a pencil behind the ear of his bald head, and suspicious eyes for customers who came in off the steamy, seedy sidewalk.
		</div>
		<div>
            I bent down to tie my shoelace, an old diversionary tactic that I learnt from private dick school, when a lady with a tray of burgers crashed over me and snapped her pretty ankle.
		</div>
        <div>
            'Oh, hey Joe,' I said, walking to the counter where he was mopping some split soda. 'Do the words "interstellar sphincter" mean anything to you?' I noticed he had a tattoo of a dove on his left buttock, a real giveaway when you wear gold hot pants.
		</div>
		<div>
            'You're barking up the wrong tree, mister,' he replied. I asked to use his telephone, it was time to make a call to the number that was scribbled on the cryptic note that was stuffed in the mouth of the bloated... 'One vanilla milkshake, man, with the pink twirly straw,' I shouted to Giuseppe, covering the mouthpiece of the phone with my hand.
		</div>

		</div>
		<div>
            I called the number scribbled on the cryptic note stuffed in the mouth of the bloated fat man, and a dame picked up the receiver. She said, 'Meet me at the park, sugar'.
		</div>
		<div>
            'The bloated fat man was a flute player in my jazz band. Gee, his fingers have been burnt.'
		</div>
        <div>
            I said, 'Sure, doll'. The cryptic note was unravelling in front of my puffy eyes.

		<div>
            I was sitting in the diner, slurping my vanilla milkshake through a twirly straw.
		</div>
		<div>
            Giuseppe handed me the receiver, it was the pink dame returning my call.
		</div>
        <div>
            We met in the park, she told me the bloated fat man had a golden flute.
		</div>
		<div>
            Oh, will I ever see her again, red lips and her twisted foot?

		<div>
            I found the next victim - or at least bits of him - at The Los Angeles Zoological Society reptile enclosure. The keepers were tight-lipped, saying only that he slipped and fell over a 12-foot fence into the croc pit.
		</div>
		<div>
            The ring on his finger was engraved with the address "12 Melrose Place". I'm curious.

		</div>
		<div>
            A big fat yellow bird arrived with a note in its beak. "Danger awaits at Melrose Place" was scribbled in lipstick on the perfume-scented paper. Bless the stool pigeon and her twisted foot.
		</div>
		<div>
            But if I've learnt one thing from private dick school, it's that rats don't flutter to you unless they have wings. Time to don the trench coat and take a drive out east.

		<div>
            Melrose Place was a swanky joint, full of rich time bankers and city wallets. But it wasn't just the smell of the dollar that tickled my nostrils. A sick sweet scent on the breeze led me to the garage door.
		</div>
		<div>
            The flies and maggots had been feasting for an aeon. He was the third victim to be jotted in my notebook, but the first of the case. The name badge on his uniform said "Tommy Brambles, Interstellar Toilet Cleaning Company". 
		</div>
		<div>
            What was a urinal polisher doing at the empty house of a city banker? And why were his pockets stuffed with cigars? My nostrils were flaring out wider than a pit horse on steroids.
        </div>
		<div>
            The murder weapon was outside on the driveway. Bits of a rusted pipe, dripping in little Tommy's blood. Something's giving me the heebie-jeebies man, and it's not my great aunt's vasectomy snippers. I'm on the freak.
		</div>
		<div>
            Brussels sprouts. Oh, new potatoes. I'm short on gravy.

		<div>
           I'm absolutely furious, man. 12 Melrose Place is just a facade.
		</div>
		<div>
           I could really do with a cup of coffee and a foot rub. Instead I've been dished the bum steer. But up here in my basket, I can see all the little dots. And they're spelling out the name Giuseppe. 
		</div>

		<div>
           Back at the office, all the little dots in my notepad sketched out a dove.
		</div>
		<div>
           It was the crest of the Interstellar Toilet Cleaning Company.
		</div>
		<div>
           And the feathery rat that adorned the fat man's stolen flute.
		</div>
		<div>
           And the tattoo on Giuseppe's left buttock, exposed by his hiked-up hot pants.
		</div>
		<div>
           If that's any help? My gosh, I feel like a walrus with stomach cramps - the next move is going to hurt. And I'm not the sort to make a pretty dame cry.

		<div>
           I tapped Giuseppe's telephone. It made for interesting reading.
		</div>
		<div>
           'The part is buried in a crate of cigars. You can collect it round the back, there will be a couple of delivery men waiting for you. No, show them the papers. Take the crate to 12 Melrose Place, our agent will exchange it for your envelope. Please listen, the machine must be working by midnight, do you understand? There must be no delay. Otherwise she will hurt us all.'
		</div>
		<div>
           Otherwise she will hurt us all? Oh my, the pretty dame had Giuseppe whimpering like a flea-bitten dog in chains. Just what sort of fruity magic was she casting? And why was Giuseppe packing machinery into cigar crates? It was time to do some snooping down at the warehouse.

		<div>
			I have had the invoices destroyed, and the bodies disposed of. The tattoo of a dove has been surgically removed from my left buttock. But still the dame, she extorts me. And there is a private detective snooping about the warehouse. A man can take no more. It is time to let the flea-bitten rabid dogs out of their cages.

		<div>
			Please don't feed me to the snake. I beg of your better heart. You see, I was once a little boy, and my father had a stable. We had a horse called Rodger, who won the county steeplechase three years in a row. Imagine that. Oh, how I yearn to return to the farm and tend my spuds. I promise to peel them every night, even if my fingers are raw and bleeding. You could drive the tractor my love, it's a simple contraption, with only one gearstick. What do you say?
	    </div>
		<div>
			Mobster mama, you knock my cotton socks off. Oh, free me from these chains and we'll forget the corpses. Roll the dice, pretty dame, roll the dice on my brittle bones, shoo-wop, shoo-wop.
