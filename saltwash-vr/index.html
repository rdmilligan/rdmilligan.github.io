			When I was alive, all I thought about was heaps of rubbish. Now I'm dead, I just can't stop looking at the beautiful human face, with its furrowed brow and wanting eyes and twitching nose and wishing ears and wet lips and giving mouth and pimpled chin. How did I not think about the face before?

		</div>			
		<div>
			Well, this is it then. I'm dead. It's a bit of a weight off my shoulders, to be frank. No more nonsense with the gods and their copper begging bowls. Golly, it's just a corridor of dust. I thought there would be some shells, husks or whatnot. But the rumble of an actor's belly, has it gone? My pedigree, to be someone else's clay.

		<div>
			A bomb rips out a building set overseas. It's a damn inconvenience this spreading disease. My government wired to paint over the political creep. Wet chemicals stick to my clothes, but the tongue is so sweet. Alliances gel to lay the big sandy pipes. Beneficiaries in shadows, villages set out in a dark howling hell. I'll bring back the bones in my rucksack if the mechanics of war sell. It's harder to think without a mahogany desk. And the maps on the wall that have dots for the dead.

		<div>
			Look into their weepy eyes. Each reflects the sick pig tossed to the gangway, left writhing in agony. And the mother locked in a metal grill, she cannot turn to love her suckling offspring. 
		</div>			
		<div>
			Broken bits of bloated chicken flesh and gristle and what not in cinema bargain buckets. The crush of steel cages yields to a jolly cardboard wall. Where are the feet, burnt by their shit? Mushed in with what not.
		</div>			
		<div>
			Shall I turn my rifle on you, or shoot off my head? The movie was glorious and gory, but I feel sad instead. I caught sight of what I've done to the chickens and pigs and civilians and Fred and buried myself in my bed. 
		</div>			
		<div>
			I dreamt of a chainsaw carving me up. I was pinned on the rotisserie spike, good Lord, an oil-licked human kebab. Whilst a pig pointed a trotter at me, and the chicken staff squirted hot sauce on slices of me stuffed in pita bread. 
		</div>			
		<div>
			But I have been educated and civilized at schools with tight doors. My position in Government is to weed out the weak, with dossiers and bombs sent overseas. By each meaty sandwich and hollowed-out smoking tenement block, the world is a safer place, Fred.

		<div>
			Just an actor on set. By parkour or a bus pass, man.

			I'm conducting some parkour between acting jobs. You know, to keep my toes nimble.
		</div>			
		<div>
			Got to get my messages. Take a plastic bag, to recycle. Tin of cat food, for the cat. And clippers, for my toes. Nails making a bloody pulp in my sock. Batteries for the radio.

			Oh, hi y'all. I'm taking my two daughters to a Saltwash Cinema. What great snacks. And a super sound system. Just love that bangin' bass, girls, eh? Least the chicken's got a bit of space to flex, now they're out the cage. And cheap cups of slurp from the abattoir floor, bang on. Oh Lord, I can't stick these commercials, my heart's a bruised plum.

			Gorgeous day outside, but let's be brutal in sheds. Hard concrete slabs with a pile of brown stuff. Fit in tighter, bloated, puss pouring red raw eyes. Electricity, hooks, it annoys me when they cry. In plastic now so it looks like plant-based. Although I am devastatingly sad, I'm told it's more natural this way.

			Stuart log 856723. My audition for Prussian serf fell flat. I didn't even get to wear the smock.

		<div>
			How come?
		</div>	
		<div>
			I've been put through the mangle of a black hole, my particulars turned into mush. I did ask the director if I could at least keep my teeth.
		</div>	
		<div>
			Sorry about that Stuart, but in this business one needs to take it on the chin.
		</div>
		<div>
			I don't even have a chin, Trevor, just a mush of fingernails and bone shards. Oh well, back to painting automobiles.

			Spaceship clowns.
		</div>
		<div>
			This is amazing, man, I'm like in space. It's all very like, I don't know how it feels emotionally really, it's just very special, I suppose is the word. You know, it's kind of fits and starts. But you know, I'm not particular. But I won't be sold down the river. 
		</div>
		<div>
			Well, it's fantastic to be in space. Look, must stop the spaceship blowing up. It's every chance if we don't press that button over there. But it could happen. Not really in my thoughts. But maybe in the council. Or other such situations.

			A mother and her son sit around a campfire, spit roasting a pig. The son asks his mother, 'Where is Benji?' A man at a campfire next to the mother and son is spit roasting a dog. The man asks the son, 'Is this Benji? I thought he was feral'. Two dogs at a campfire next to the man are spit roasting a boy. One of the dogs says, 'We're feral'.

			You should take a leaf out of my book and get some exercise. An actor needs to be pumped.

		</div>	
		<div>
			Got myself a short-term job painting cars. All apples taste sour, you know.
		</div>
		<div>
			This is the intersection between order and dismay. Where my abandoned notes lay. Scattered over concrete blocks. Metal pronged intent. I cast a gleeful eye on my descent. Celebrate my notions. And wasted my mistakes. Celebrate my notions.

			Who's knocking?

		<div>
			Oh, hi Stuart. It's Trevor.
		</div>
		<div>
			Oh, hi Trevor. How's it hanging? Have you found another acting job? I've not had any luck since my detective part.
		</div>
		<div>
			Well, hmm, would you mind letting me in Stuart, so we can speak face to face.
		</div>
		<div>
			Oh yeah, sorry Trevor. My manners are all pots and pans today.

			I do not have the book of weirdness, I screamed. My surgeon borrowed it and has yet to return. He sits alone in a cave flicking through each page and acting the prose. Retreating the glow. Tired of opening doors to the soul. Like cellar steps to broken bones. They cry, straighten me from the toxic brawl. While he sits on his hands, wanting to twist these bones. Into a flock of red birds or an athlete lean.

			I'm telling you man, the dog disgraced herself. I had to be there with the tissues. The chillies take their toll, and there's no amount of preparation that can, you know, prepare for it. A trail of slime will be kids play, but let's get up the hatch and out of the hot pan first.
		</div>			
		<div>

		<div>
			Legs on fire. Amputee.

			A man walked up the highway. It was hot. He was thirsty. And the cars that passed by were knocking dust in his face. Finally, he got into town and met her at the cafe. Black coffee. He read the newspaper. She was filing her nails or something. An advertisement for a carburetor caught his eye, and he remembered. A highway. And a concrete office block with stacks of beer bottle windows. And a voting sticker on one of the windows. He understood somewhat why he walked up the highway.

			I knocked over Edmund's ashtray at the stroke of eleven. And the butts rolled away from the ash. But their peppery steps led back to the frozen burnt orange glass. Like the length of string tied to my ankle. As I vaulted the fence of the pen. And scrambled up to the bow of the brae. And saw families picnic under a cold moon. And woman swam in a dark lagoon. With their swimming caps a glassy gloom. Men knelt by a bank crafting bows with old tools. Frightened eyes of deer like shining pins. In a matchstick forest above a glen. But the taut string let me peek no harder. And whipped me tight back to the pen. Rolling my spongy orange body in stone shaping steps. I writhed in the glue of my sunken pepper sky. As Edmund struck two matches onto the hot ashy stack.

			Oh, hi sweetie. I've got myself a job as a crane driver at the factory, so I can snoop on the mayor taking bribes from the factory owner. You know, to turn a blind eye to the factory pumping a glowing goo into the swamp. Crystal meths, man.
		</div>

			Don't fry the meat but eat. And let the jelly blood drip down your chin. And trickle onto the Adam's apple of your throat. And onto the collar of your old man's shirt. Put away your spear, dear. And take your daughter's car into Asda. Where the chemical birds pull in. On filthy conveyor belts that loop the globe. Feathers and frightened pellets of shit. Sketches of nature's trees and leaves. On the cellophane that wraps the pimpled breast. Oh, festive greetings Grandmother. And the jelly blood nappy stains. 
		</div>	
		<div>
			Oh, don't mind my mannequin, it's malfunctioning again. I've got incriminating sketches of the mayor taking a bribe on a big wheel gondola. Bang to rights, sir.

		<div>
			And each load fell into itself. And each sound reverberated to the end. Discontent in every holding. I held my thoughts in tired times. While others collected words from city bins. Shoring up a slipping heap. Bullish men now tread in tears. Watching concrete melt away. Cycles falling on their weight. Cherished places are moving out. A family that is losing each other. And though my hands still bear the markings. There are new alliances in my head.
		</div>	
		<div>
			The mayor has invited me for dinner, after our game of dinosaur disco. Time to talk turkey about the poison-tipped mosquito and the factory pumping a glowing goo into the swamp.

			Oh, hi there. I've just got myself off the two fifteen train to the East. Nothing but sand for as far as the mutton balls can squint. The train guard was giving me beef about my ticket, said the stamp was only valid to Pumpkin Press Hills. Get out of here, man, I snapped, and started to roll up my cotton sleeves. A burly gentleman with a dicky bow tie had to pin me to the floor of the carriage, for the rolled-up clump of meat bones that I posted on the surly officer's chin. Quite the stir. Be just my plums to appear on the front page of the Eastern Times, my mug shot rousing the moustaches of the client's clients. Best just get to the camel races, with the beer in my suitcases.

			Hey, waiter, have your mutton lugs heard of trouble at an antique department store. It's not far off the sandy dunes, a coastal town where a lady walks in tweed and thick stockings, a pretty pink scarf to wrap the sparkles. I've pencilled a crooked line on my map of her misdemeanours. Best sip up before another ancient gem vanishes.
		</div>	
        <div>
			Sorry, sweet lips, I know nothing about the stolen diamonds. Sip up, the weather is soon to take a turn for the worst, and I'll throw a canopy over the lagoon and jot orders at the Sea Salt Cafe. Button mushrooms are on specials.

        <div>
			You asked me if the flowers were sweet, I hadn’t tasted, I hadn’t thought to. Though I have to say as I look around, the wonder of your garden must have knocked me to the ground. And then it came to me. Could I say it happened here today? It’s those simple things, they leave you unaware.

        <div>
			There's an old water tank a hundred yards up that fills on monsoon and gushes the rails. You'd think they'd dismantle it, but the weepy-eyed porter took out an ad, "Heritage grows in rust", odd. And the folks drilled a sewage pipe, to cart the reddish wash to mush. The road sags now.

        <div>
			I'm picking up on the wireless radio fixed to my scooter. The syndicate are stubbing out their fat cigars and chattering like parrots. Film and voices, sugar, it will be an open-and-shut case. Smokey beaks will be slammed behind long rusted bars. And folks can pull their itchy blankets around in a wrap and weep. Sob over the worn constructs that dot the steel tracks. Silly, battered old rock.

			And I see a city. The love that rests in every moving eye. The true line that runs through every jarring smile. And though my arms will reach only so far.
		</div>
        <div>
			The clown transported the stolen bank funds in balloons to his illicit establishments. And I was too smitten with love to lock the cuffs.
		</div>	
        <div>
			And I see a city. A heart that needs to beat free from tailored bonds. A tenderness which casts shadows forlorn. And though my arms will reach only so far.

        <div>
			A foot or so from the pit, the lion turns to beckon on. Okay, first question please, my answers are silent, still anyway. A Roman said to me, is progress all it’s cracked up to be? I say, I do not know, I’m not sure direction even has a place to go. Oh, come now, we have seen you walk our roads. Yes, I step outside and there they are. The sun has a peculiar effect on me, you see, I’m not trying to get from A to B. 
		</div>
        <div>
			Oh, ratty, can you feel the air brushing through your fur? And the sweet scent of the pines?
		</div>	
        <div>
			Answer now or face the jaw, the rhythmic swish of the claw. Where to, now the stone is laid? Why is it in these moments a simple bluff evades?
		</div>	
        <div>
			I thank the turbulent heavens that a lightning bolt struck the branch that fell on the executioner's head. And that my head is still firmly attached to its shoulders. If I never see another case file again it will be too soon, my oily friend. Take a left to an apartment at the dunes, and I will slice us some watermelon.

        <div>
			I'm skirting round the floorboards, my breath is dragging down the walls. I'm messed up in your bed clothes but I'm gone. We applied a transient religion, the strangest stories are never told. Has left cardboard on your windows and a heart full of holes.
		</div>
        <div>
			The blunt metal edge, it glints for the demon. His trumpet and glass balls will soon be chopped clean off. A hoot for the boss, no?
		</div>	
        <div>
			Yes, the demon's hoofed footprints will no longer decorate the shores of this dusty sphere. A royal handkerchief has been stuffed in the pocket of our Queen, we await her command. Old treasure will fill this bucket, a sloppy mess to feed the hungry birds.
		</div>	
        <div>
			Oh, ratty. My memory tree is winding to an end. And there's pungent oil in my brogues. Alas, my dear rodent, farewell.

		</div>		
        <div>
			The blunt metal edge, no?
		</div>
        <div>
			I stole sweets today, because I could, I take. It's ok, it's ok. No one knows the proper price to pay, and I stole them anyway. Think not of consequence, we're a nation in defence. The poor are poor, they know of life that way. I do what I can and prey empty. I just don’t feel it.
		</div>	
        <div>
			We keep the demon in its shell, until the axe brushes this thief from our cherished shores. Boss will stir from slumber soon enough to wave the royal handkerchief, a cotton blade.
		</div>	
        <div>
			Oh, man. My goose is cooked. I've only got a morsel of hours until my head it chopped clean off.

        <div>
			But best we crush this poor rodent, it be intent on feasting your paper lots.

        <div>

        <div>
			That didn't work out very well then. Thankfully I managed to parachute down into this field using one of the clown's bladders of cash, before the plane crashed into the side of a mountain.

        <div>
			Oh, man. That bull looks peeved. I may have just deposited manure into the flannels that wrap my mechanical parts and internal piping.

			That's right guys, my hot air balloon is out of action. So I'm taking this military plane into the skies, to pop the clown's bladders of cash.

        <div>
			I'm up in the air, Sheila my dear, flowers blossom but once a year. And my breast pocket pens rattle, Sheila my dear.

        <div>
			I got myself lost on the way to the clown's factory and ended up in this graveyard. Someone must have tampered with the public highway signage. It's really spooky. I've seen a bat and heard the crunch of a footstep. I fear one of these tombstones has my name on it. I don't want to perish, mother.
		</div>
        <div>
			Mother, you never did really love me, you said I would amount to nothing. Mother, you put oil in my brogues, and a banana skin in my sandwiches. Oh, look at me now.

		</div>		
        <div>
			Slinkies is a plush nightclub that the city banker hung out at, before flipping his heels in the city banking corporation. I asked around the joint for Sheila, the name scribbled on the card. Turns out the dame was up close and cosy with a clown. A bulbous-nosed bone breaker that had his golden name badge on a head table scattered with flasks of champagne and plates of prime Scottish steak. I stole a chip. And the address of a factory downtown where the clown puts his goons to foul games.
		</div>
        <div>
			I eat. I, like, breathe man. But I won't sleep until I get that clown in the sandpit for a little game of twist twist.

		</div>		
        <div>
			The city banker was still clutching his briefcase as he lay splatted on the marble floor. It was chained to his bony wrist, but full of old newspapers. In the breast pocket of his suit was a card for a plush nightclub, with the handwritten note "5:30 Sheila bring flask". I smelt a red rose, soaked in foul oils. And I'll tell you that for nothing.
		</div>
        <div>
			Every egg I've cracked, shell and yolk, has rotted foul. Am I worth a thousand rubles? I took to the play, but my lines tripped inside me. Am I worth a thousand rubles? If the dame has the cow, I have a plough, yes. I am worth a thousand rubles.
		</div>		
        <div>
			The square in front of the City Banking Corporation is great for unicycling. I feel like a trifle on a paper plate.

		</div>		
        <div>
			I've thumbed through the heady case notes for the cold-blooded murder on the spiral stairs of a city banking corporation. A bigwig tripped over his shoelaces and flapped on down to crimson-splatted artwork on the marble-floored atrium. The teller had to clear his throat of sick before winding a call to the police. What a mess. But I'm a badger just wanting to be itched. Time to ask some questions downtown at the money vault.

			The dame has chartered a private plane to take us back from our holidays. What a smashing amount of legroom, you can really wiggle your toes. And I've had a cocktail or two, sorry, and I'm not even afraid of flying. The long-haul flight has let me thumb through the case notes for the cold-blooded murder on the spiral stairs of a city banking corporation. It doesn't really stack up. What a head-scratcher for a rat-catcher.

		</div>
		<div>
			I wonder if you could help me, I'm looking for a couple of dear friends at the hotel. He's as bald as a toothbrush and she has a golden coiffure.
		</div>
		<div>
			You threw scraps into my litter tray. Oh, my dame, what a swell holiday. But we're back to the dirty, gritty, greyscale thirties. Let me scrape the grime and crime from between your toes. Put your twisted foot into my office brogues. Oh, my dame.

What do you say, dame, let's paint the holiday resort red. Hit the pretty heights of a crimson-teared skyline, and we're never gonna stall the engines of this little rocket.
		</div>
		<div>
			I know a puppeteer in Sweden who could grant us a discount on old-fashioned clothes. Jackets are a bit tight, but the finest tweed this side of Estonia. And you can unstitch the pockets to rest your horns. Man, this beat is earthing my bones.

Otherwise she will hurt us all.'

           Otherwise she will hurt us all? Oh my, the pretty dame had Giuseppe whimpering like a flea-bitten dog in chains. Just what sort of fruity magic was she casting? And why was Giuseppe packing machinery into cigar crates? It was time to do some snooping down at the warehouse.

           I could really do with a cup of coffee and a foot rub. Instead I've been dished the bum steer. But up here in my basket, I can see all the little dots. And they're spelling out the name Giuseppe.

            7. I'm short on gravy

            Melrose Place was a swanky joint, full of rich time bankers and city wallets. But it wasn't just the smell of the dollar that tickled my nostrils. A sick sweet scent on the breeze led me to the garage door.
		</div>
		<div>
            The flies and maggots had been feasting for an aeon. He was the third victim to be jotted in my notebook, but the first of the case. The name badge on his uniform said "Tommy Brambles, Interstellar Toilet Cleaning Company". 
		</div>
		<div>
            What was a urinal polisher doing at the empty house of a city banker? And why were his pockets stuffed with cigars? My nostrils were flaring out wider than a pit horse on steroids.
        </div>
		<div>
            The murder weapon was outside on the driveway. Bits of a rusted pipe, dripping in little Tommy's blood. Something's giving me the heebie-jeebies man, and it's not my great aunt's vasectomy snippers. I'm on the freak.
		</div>
		<div>
            Brussels sprouts. Oh, new potatoes. I'm short on gravy.

            6. A drive out east

		<div>
            A big fat yellow bird arrived with a note in its beak. "Danger awaits at Melrose Place" was scribbled in lipstick on the perfume-scented paper. Bless the stool pigeon and her twisted foot.
		</div>
		<div>
            But if I've learnt one thing from private dick school, it's that rats don't flutter to you unless they have wings. Time to don the trench coat and take a drive out east.

            5. Ring on his finger

            I found the next victim - or at least bits of him - at The Los Angeles Zoological Society reptile enclosure. The keepers were tight-lipped, saying only that he slipped and fell over a 12-foot fence into the croc pit.
		</div>
		<div>
            The ring on his finger was engraved with the address "12 Melrose Place". I'm curious.

		<div>
            I was sitting in the diner, slurping my vanilla milkshake through a twirly straw.
		</div>
		<div>
            Giuseppe handed me the receiver, it was the pink dame returning my call.
		</div>
        <div>
            We met in the park, she told me the bloated fat man had a golden flute.
		</div>
		<div>
            Oh, will I ever see her again, red lips and her twisted foot?
		</div>

            3. My puffy eyes

		</div>
		<div>
            I called the number scribbled on the cryptic note stuffed in the mouth of the bloated fat man, and a dame picked up the receiver. She said, 'Meet me at the park, sugar'.
		</div>
		<div>
            'The bloated fat man was a flute player in my jazz band. Gee, his fingers have been burnt.'
		</div>
        <div>
            I said, 'Sure, doll'. The cryptic note was unravelling in front of my puffy eyes.

            2. Snapped her pretty ankle

		<div>
            The diner belonged to an old Italian gentleman by the name of Giuseppe, who had a penchant for rolled-up shirtsleeves and a pencil behind the ear of his bald head, and suspicious eyes for customers who came in off the steamy, seedy sidewalk.
		</div>
		<div>
            I bent down to tie my shoelace, an old diversionary tactic that I learnt from private dick school, when a lady with a tray of burgers crashed over me and snapped her pretty ankle.
		</div>
        <div>
            'Oh, hey Joe,' I said, walking to the counter where he was mopping some split soda. 'Do the words "interstellar sphincter" mean anything to you?' I noticed he had a tattoo of a dove on his left buttock, a real giveaway when you wear gold hot pants.
		</div>
		<div>
            'You're barking up the wrong tree, mister,' he replied. I asked to use his telephone, it was time to make a call to the number that was scribbled on the cryptic note that was stuffed in the mouth of the bloated... 'One vanilla milkshake, man, with the pink twirly straw,' I shouted to Giuseppe, covering the mouthpiece of the phone with my hand.

        </div>
		<div>
            I smelt trouble the moment that broad walked into my office and flirted her false eyelashes at me. She'd lead me to three dead corpses and a stolen flute.
		</div>
		<div>
            Oh, hi guys, I'm living in the 1930's as a private dick, and it's gritty and dirty and greyscale, and you never know if you're gonna wind up in a house with a beautiful dame or a bloated fat man with a cryptic note stuffed in his mouth, and a book of matches that lead you to the seedy diner on 54th and a half street where you can slurp milkshakes through a twirly pink straw and listen to the jukebox shoo-wop shooby-doo-wop, and the bathrooms are clean.
