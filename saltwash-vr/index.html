        <div>
			I found the precious vase in an airing cupboard at 12 Melrose Place and made good my escape. It's a pretty pink flamingo. Once the dust settles, I will leave my hiding spot and collect the reward. Bahamas, get your dancing soles on!

        <div>
			12 Melrose Place has a really smart gymnasium. I'm powdering my palms.
		</div>		
        <div>
			Pumping iron must yield to finding that vase, before those criminals spot me. Wonder why my client yearns for it so bad? But I don't ask questions, just sniffing the clues.

		</div>	
        <div>
			12 Melrose Place is still a facade, but perhaps somewhere in this half-baked architecture is the precious vase. Clues fall from to the lips of ugly and pretty criminals, but hush my love, or they will unleash killer worms on me. My bones rattle in horror.

        <div>
			Oh, hi guys. I'm just in a dream. Vibing those killer worms.
		</div>	
		<div>
			I want to hold the hand of fortune in desperate measures, I want to collude with my own demise. Yet such methods only falter, I disturbed the birds that flock on religious tides.

        <div>
			What a smack of luck. A big fat yellow bird swooped down just before the killer worm sunk its incisors in my leg.

			Take me to 12 Melrose Place my feathery friend. Time for some ornamental snooping.

        <div>
			Oh, man. I'm cornered on the arm of this crane, and the killer worm is licking its incisors. Someone let it out of its cage with a rag of my odour dabbed under its nostrils. The case of the vanishing vase has taken an ugly turn. And my brogues ain't so steady.

		</div>		
        <div>
			We jumped into a burned-out bed. My impulse, however, has long been dead. I want it back.
		</div>	
        <div>
			Oh man, I had to get out of that apartment, the monster's jaws smashed through the window and was dripping saliva on the rug.
		</div>	
        <div>
			I can breathe life into this frame. And fill above our memories.
		</div>
        <div>
			I'm trapped on this roof, but the thorn bird let me tickle his wings. Maybe it can carry my bulk over those orange hills?
		</div>
        <div>
			A clammed shell to prise apart. A craftsman, I am a work of art. A waking rainbow on your dawn. I etch the boundaries before I draw.
		</div>

		</div>		
        <div>
			There is a monster outside the blinds, trying to peek in.
		</div>	
        <div>
			This is not dandy. I've had to take shelter in an apartment on the sixth floor. But I can hear the monster snorting outside, its jaws are salivating for my flesh. Maybe there's squid in the fridge?
		</div>

		</div>		
        <div>
			Wow, the fizzy pop cans, bottles and junk food cartons are the refuse of a city on the orange planet. Oh my, we are not alone in the sooty universe, there are other sophisticated species capable of fashioning concrete and scattering trash. How can I scramble down from this plateau and shake their glutinous hands? 
		</div>	
        <div>
			Oh my, I'm no sooner out of the quicksand but into quite another pickle. Buckle my breeches, mother.

		</div>		
        <div>
			What are all these fizzy pop cans, bottles and junk food cartons doing on the orange planet?
		</div>	
        <div>
			The chemicals coming off the aliens has had a detrimental effect on my physical particulars. I'm walking and talking funny. I must get the medical kit from the knackered rocket and return to the dame post-haste.
		</div>
        <div>
			Oh, man. I've got myself into a pickle with some quicksand.

		</div>		
        <div>
			Waiting for the cows to come home, you know. An indescribable fear. It was a birthday cake with pink and white sprinkles, a lemon tart would have been okay.
		</div>	
        <div>
			If you can reach in for the stopcock, that would be grand, just twist it a bit to the left until you hear it gush. I'm talking in cypher, don't want to upset the aliens. Lest they clobber me whilst my spaceship is knackered.

		</div>		
        <div>
			Oh, my dame. You twist roses on my iron gates and feather my shirt collars. The smokey beaks had me battered from stone paths and fireflies to an ashy volcanic outpost. My lids were sealing up. But a sweet oil fluttered on the breeze and knocked those chattering parrots from their twigs. I have taken out a library book, my sick twisted dame, with charts and scripts of a planet not so far. The rocket nails may shake and pop, but soon we will taste that candy orange lolly. Blast us to the fizz.
		</div>
        <div>
			Oh, David listen, please come on home. Can still you hear the night bird sing above the monotone? Simple words that should ring true, now ring so far out of tune, that I'm not sure if I still know myself.
		</div>	
        <div>
			At Fergus Rock, I was lost. By Fergus Rock I looked for you. At Fergus Rock, the sound was warped. By Fergus Rock I looked for you. An electric miracle. I’m lost in the electric blue.

		</div>		
        <div>
			All the angels in darkened eves, calling out your name. Knowing of what you and I became.
		</div>
        <div>
			Marble, stone, gave presence, gave home, to our unending scripts. Oil and canvas bore disapproving eyes in our quest for truth. All the angels in darkened eves, calling out your name. Dare not whisper.
		</div>	
        <div>
			The light floods every choice, our written words cost dear. With your hesitation they weave more restraints, while my knowing self slips away.

		</div>		
        <div>
			Fruity has wild hallucinations. Muttering about if the flowers were sweet. Let's put his rump in the motor.
		</div>
        <div>
			Quick, before fruity stirs from slumber. Cart him to the dock master.
		</div>	
        <div>
			Of all the ways to wait, I shall entertain them all. To play a role or to refuse, there is a character for us all. Though play we must, and accept we shall. To pave your path with a mirage of reasons.
		</div>	
        <div>
			Bitterness is knocking, shall I let it in? Glee scarcely mends the heart, stuffed in between the pain. Am I wiser with the books, at peace and understand? Or has my voice gone stale, thoughts too dense to dance?
		</div>	
		<h3>
			39. Rust on my skin

		</div>		
        <div>
			I’m not about to say anything really, still, there’s rust on my skin. And as I lie in this flower bed, is it unreasonable to ask why? Time is missing from my wrist, can I ask you why a truck has hit? Furthermore could you assist, not a stitch of cloth on my soul and my leg is limp.
		</div>
        <div>
			You asked me if the flowers were sweet, I hadn’t tasted, I hadn’t thought to. Though I have to say as I look around, the wonder of your garden must have knocked me to the ground. And then it came to me. Could I say it happened here today? It’s those simple things, they leave you unaware.
		</div>	
        <div>
			The soil feels good under my nails, I want to stand now, shall I try? So you walk me through, round the paths, and I smell the wood and it took me back. To when I was young, I knew of nothing more. And as I fell, and as I fell, who’d have thought that I’d be caught.
		</div>
		<h3>
			38. Prairie dogs

		</div>		
        <div>
			I don’t want to find you there tonight. Staggering stupid when the saloon clock chimes for midnight. I want for you to be, beyond the red valley, galloping over the western clover.
		</div>
        <div>
			The sheriff handed back my gun. He said at best I would die young. But I’ll stay home tonight, to fuel the firelight.
		</div>	
        <div>
			You know, I've found myself in a perilous situation, my buckets breached. The smokey beaks are ready to shred me to the prairie dogs.
		</div>	
        <div>
			All the cattle have been branded with a cross. The Harrisons expect some loss. Though I am not afraid.
		</div>			
        <div>
			Though I am a tad nervous, I'll confess. I stuck my office brogue in a paint pot and rattled a couple of spanners off a shelf, and started the parrots off squawking for the seeds. Oh my, an old sewer pipe has breached my buckets.
		</div>

			37. Falafel night

		</div>		
        <div>
			That's right guys, yeah, it's a battered old rock. But I just keep on pressing my gold-tipped pin into its mushy hoop, who cares if it's a donkey or a mule that hee-haws.
		</div>
        <div>
			I breathe and feed. Give vent to my alcoholic needs. This does not mean I’m alive.
		</div>	
        <div>
			My socks have holes in them, but my breast pocket has a little silver case of needle and thread. And my nostrils scent a syndicate in an old shoe shed down at the docks. Old brogues, bleached money. The type of credit notes that shift off the decks in wooden crates.
		</div>	
        <div>
			Or have the surprises just begun?
		</div>			
        <div>
			Thursday, it's falafel night. Just a couple of snaps from my camera, and I'll scoff those spicy chickpea balls whilst the film develops. You know when your hackles are up, right? This will make the front page, and my office be an armadillo with a tail of dames curling round and beyond the red brick station. And paper stand.
		</div>			
        <div>
			There's an old water tank a hundred yards up that fills on monsoon and gushes the rails. You'd think they'd dismantle it, but the weepy-eyed porter took out an ad, "Heritage grows in rust", odd. And the folks drilled a sewage pipe, to cart the reddish wash to mush. The road sags now.
		</div>	
        <div>
			I'm picking up on the wireless radio fixed to my scooter. The syndicate are stubbing out their fat cigars and chattering like parrots. Film and voices, sugar, it will be an open-and-shut case. Smokey beaks will be slammed behind long rusted bars. And folks can pull their itchy blankets around in a wrap and weep. Sob over the worn constructs that dot the steel tracks. Silly, battered old rock.
		</div>	
        <div>
			There're wasps everywhere. Ice lollies. Pink and yellow swirl stripes.
		</div>

		</div>		
        <div>
			I've got wild hallucinations. I shouldn't have eaten that mouldy sandwich.
		</div>
        <div>
			Farewell to these city walls, protect the flesh while the soul should fall. If the guards should not believe me, perhaps they will if I do not return. Pass the market by the morning light, the trader calls of his delights. The jewels you hold so high shall not quench my journey’s thirst.
		</div>	
        <div>
			Crushing crime is no picnic. I'm waving bye-bye to the dunes.
		</div>	
        <div>
			The city beggar calls out to me, if you leave you shall be destitute. Though I stand cloaked in gold, the rags are all he sees. The city planner runs towards me, don’t you know, there's so much work to be done. All the stones we laid the day before need to be built upon.
		</div>			
        <div>
			There's a new case down at the docks. Time to crack open a few crates.
		</div>			
        <div>
			Unlock the iron gate and run into the sun.
		</div>

		</div>		
        <div>
			And I see a city. The love that rests in every moving eye. The true line that runs through every jarring smile. And though my arms will reach only so far.
		</div>
        <div>
			The clown transported the stolen bank funds in balloons to his illicit establishments. And I was too smitten with love to lock the cuffs.
		</div>	
        <div>
			And I see a city. A heart that needs to beat free from tailored bonds. A tenderness which casts shadows forlorn. And though my arms will reach only so far.

		</div>		
        <div>
			A foot or so from the pit, the lion turns to beckon on. Okay, first question please, my answers are silent, still anyway. A Roman said to me, is progress all it’s cracked up to be? I say, I do not know, I’m not sure direction even has a place to go. Oh, come now, we have seen you walk our roads. Yes, I step outside and there they are. The sun has a peculiar effect on me, you see, I’m not trying to get from A to B. 
		</div>
        <div>
			Oh, ratty, can you feel the air brushing through your fur? And the sweet scent of the pines?
		</div>	
        <div>
			Answer now or face the jaw, the rhythmic swish of the claw. Where to, now the stone is laid? Why is it in these moments a simple bluff evades?
		</div>	
        <div>
			I thank the turbulent heavens that a lightning bolt struck the branch that fell on the executioner's head. And that my head is still firmly attached to its shoulders. If I never see another case file again it will be too soon, my oily friend. Take a left to an apartment at the dunes, and I will slice us some watermelon.

        <div>
			I'm skirting round the floorboards, my breath is dragging down the walls. I'm messed up in your bed clothes but I'm gone. We applied a transient religion, the strangest stories are never told. Has left cardboard on your windows and a heart full of holes.
		</div>
        <div>
			The blunt metal edge, it glints for the demon. His trumpet and glass balls will soon be chopped clean off. A hoot for the boss, no?
		</div>	
        <div>
			Yes, the demon's hoofed footprints will no longer decorate the shores of this dusty sphere. A royal handkerchief has been stuffed in the pocket of our Queen, we await her command. Old treasure will fill this bucket, a sloppy mess to feed the hungry birds.
		</div>	
        <div>
			Oh, ratty. My memory tree is winding to an end. And there's pungent oil in my brogues. Alas, my dear rodent, farewell.

        <div>
			The blunt metal edge, no?
		</div>
        <div>
			I stole sweets today, because I could, I take. It's ok, it's ok. No one knows the proper price to pay, and I stole them anyway. Think not of consequence, we're a nation in defence. The poor are poor, they know of life that way. I do what I can and prey empty. I just don’t feel it.
		</div>	
        <div>
			We keep the demon in its shell, until the axe brushes this thief from our cherished shores. Boss will stir from slumber soon enough to wave the royal handkerchief, a cotton blade.
		</div>	
        <div>
			Oh, man. My goose is cooked. I've only got a morsel of hours until my head it chopped clean off.

			I got myself lost on the way to the clown's factory and ended up in this graveyard. Someone must have tampered with the public highway signage. It's really spooky. I've seen a bat and heard the crunch of a footstep. I fear one of these tombstones has my name on it. I don't want to perish, mother.

        <div>
			Slinkies is a plush nightclub that the city banker hung out at, before flipping his heels in the city banking corporation. I asked around the joint for Sheila, the name scribbled on the card. Turns out the dame was up close and cosy with a clown. A bulbous-nosed bone breaker that had his golden name badge on a head table scattered with flasks of champagne and plates of prime Scottish steak. I stole a chip. And the address of a factory downtown where the clown puts his goons to foul games.

        <div>

        <div>
			The city banker was still clutching his briefcase as he lay splatted on the marble floor. It was chained to his bony wrist, but full of old newspapers. In the breast pocket of his suit was a card for a plush nightclub, with the handwritten note "5:30 Sheila bring flask". I smelt a red rose, soaked in foul oils. And I'll tell you that for nothing.
		</div>
        <div>
			Every egg I've cracked, shell and yolk, has rotted foul. Am I worth a thousand rubles? I took to the play, but my lines tripped inside me. Am I worth a thousand rubles? If the dame has the cow, I have a plough, yes. I am worth a thousand rubles.

			I've thumbed through the heady case notes for the cold-blooded murder on the spiral stairs of a city banking corporation. A bigwig tripped over his shoelaces and flapped on down to crimson-splatted artwork on the marble-floored atrium. The teller had to clear his throat of sick before winding a call to the police. What a mess. But I'm a badger just wanting to be itched. Time to ask some questions downtown at the money vault.

And I've had a cocktail or two, sorry, and I'm not even afraid of flying. The long-haul flight has let me thumb through the case notes for the cold-blooded murder on the spiral stairs of a city banking corporation. It doesn't really stack up. What a head-scratcher for a rat-catcher.

Otherwise she will hurt us all.'

           Otherwise she will hurt us all? Oh my, the pretty dame had Giuseppe whimpering like a flea-bitten dog in chains. Just what sort of fruity magic was she casting? And why was Giuseppe packing machinery into cigar crates? It was time to do some snooping down at the warehouse.

            The flies and maggots had been feasting for an aeon. He was the third victim to be jotted in my notebook, but the first of the case. The name badge on his uniform said "Tommy Brambles, Interstellar Toilet Cleaning Company".

            What was a urinal polisher doing at the empty house of a city banker? And why were his pockets stuffed with cigars? My nostrils were flaring out wider than a pit horse on steroids.

            The murder weapon was outside on the driveway. Bits of a rusted pipe, dripping in little Tommy's blood. Something's giving me the heebie-jeebies man, and it's not my great aunt's vasectomy snippers. I'm on the freak.
